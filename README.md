# POLLUX 2023 Hackathon

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case.
 It stores all the details about your hard-worked video content on a blockchain making them temper-proof and giving you full access to your content. Creators can earn direct rewards from the audience in native crypto payments without any platform fees or any intermediariesIt comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.
 
 ##How we built it
 
 We built VideoGram using Solidity(For BlockChain Programming), FileCoin(Decentralized Storage), and Graph(Quering the blockchain data) and For Front-end We used NextJS+TailwindCSS.
 
 ##Challenges faced
 
Building the Sub Graph was the most challenging task. Integrating GraphQL in NextJS was also a challenging task.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
